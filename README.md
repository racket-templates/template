# template-template
This repository is a a template for creating a new Racket template. 

It comes pre-populated with some minimal configuration. If the other templates are a better choice please use one of those.

Checklist
- [ ] **Choose a licence suitable for use as a template.** - we suggest MIT but the choice is yours.
- [ ] **Is the template a working example?** It is important that the template is a close as possible working app with minimal (hopefully zero) configuration.
- [ ] Change this README.md file to provide instructions for using the template 


When your template is ready please [create an issue](https://github.com/racket-templates/template-template/issues) so we can test and fork. 

Best wishes, 

Stephen
